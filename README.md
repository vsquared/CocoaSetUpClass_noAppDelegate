# CocoaSetUpClass_noAppDelegate
Demonstrates how to create a Cocoa app programmatically with objc, but without using an AppDelegate or nibs.  An NSObject subclass called ‘SetUp’ is used to build a resizable main window with menubar and controls.  As usual, protocols may be added to the class if their respective methods are needed.
